Methodology & Technical Approach

- Analyzed 493 Massachusetts ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) using U.S. Census Bureau ACS 2019–2023 5-Year Estimates
- Integrated multiple ACS datasets covering demographics, income, education, employment, and housing characteristics
- Unified datasets using ZCTA identifiers to create a ZIP-level analytical base table
- Selected key socioeconomic indicators influencing community desirability:
    -Median household income
    -Educational attainment (% Bachelor’s degree or higher)
    -Unemployment rate
    -Housing rent burden (% paying ≥35% of income)
    -Percentage of senior population (65+)
- Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, inconsistent formats, and non-numeric fields
- Converted all analytical variables to numeric types and validated completeness across ZIP codes
- Filtered final dataset to ZIP codes with sufficient data coverage
- Applied min–max normalization to standardize all variables onto a 0–100 scale
- Treated variables directionally:
    -Positive factors (income, education): higher values score higher
    -Negative factors (unemployment, rent burden, seniors): lower values score higher
- Constructed a weighted composite desirability score using the following model:
    -Income: 25%
    -Education: 25%
    -Employment (inverse unemployment): 20%
    -Housing affordability (inverse rent burden): 20%
    -Age structure (inverse seniors): 10%
- Generated overall desirability scores ranging from approximately 26 to 86
- Evaluated score distribution using descriptive statistics, skewness, and kurtosis
- Conducted correlation analysis to identify key drivers of desirability
- Found strong positive correlations between overall score and:
    -Median income
    -Educational attainment
- Identified moderate negative correlations with unemployment and rent burden
- Performed K-Means clustering (k=4) on normalized dimension scores
- Classified ZIP codes into performance groups:
    -High Performing
    -Moderate-High
    -Moderate-Low
    -Needs Improvement
- Analyzed socioeconomic characteristics of each cluster to identify structural disparities
- Conducted regional analysis using ZIP code prefixes
- Compared performance between Greater Boston (02xx) and other Massachusetts regions (01xx)
- Performed income quintile analysis to assess inequality across ZIP codes
- Identified income as the strongest stratifier of overall desirability
- Implemented outlier detection using Z-scores to identify extreme high- and low-performing ZIP codes
- Compared top and bottom ZIP codes across all scoring dimensions
- Developed interactive visualizations using Plotly:
    -Choropleth maps of desirability scores
    -Cluster-based geographic maps
    -Scatter plots for correlation analysis
    -Distribution histograms and comparison charts
- Built an interactive web-based dashboard enabling:
    -ZIP code filtering and search
    -Multi-ZIP comparison
    -Dynamic geographic exploration
    -Detailed metric inspection via hover and tables

Technical Emphasis
- Multi-source data integration (ACS datasets)
- Feature normalization and weighted scoring models
- Statistical correlation and distribution analysis
- Unsupervised clustering (K-Means)
- Geospatial visualization and interactive dashboards
- Socioeconomic inequality analysis at ZIP-code granularity
